This paper explores the development and interconnections of various digital assets, particularly focusing on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). While cryptocurrencies generated initial excitement, they have not replaced cash and face significant regulatory challenges. Current monetary and payment systems are criticized for their inefficiency and lack of safety, which could be improved through competition. The emergence of global stablecoins like the digital Yuan and Dollar has led to a reevaluation of economic and financial systems. Despite the promise of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), performance issues limit its future potential. CBDCs, which use more traditional databases, are seen as a solution that combines the benefits of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, aiming to provide security, efficiency, financial inclusion, and stability.
